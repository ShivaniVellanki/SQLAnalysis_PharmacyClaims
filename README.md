# SQLAnalysis_PharmacyClaims
A SQL analysis project on pharmacy claims to find healthcare insights. It uses dimension and fact tables for member and drug data, employing a star schema. The goal is to analyze claims data, including demographics and drug details, to improve healthcare delivery, optimize operations, and guide policy decisions.

The project is a detailed SQL analysis of pharmacy claims data to uncover patterns and insights within a healthcare setting. By organizing the data into a structured format comprising dimension tables for member details and drug details, and a fact table for pharmacy claims, the project effectively employs a star schema for analytical processing. The input for this project includes detailed pharmacy claims data featuring member IDs, drug codes, prescription fill dates, copay amounts, and insurance payments.

The aim of the project is to analyze and understand the distribution and impact of pharmacy claims across different dimensions such as patient demographics and drug specifics. Through SQL queries and ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) mapping, the project identifies key relationships and dependencies among the data elements, facilitating complex analyses like tracking prescription fills over time, assessing insurance coverages, and evaluating medication usage patterns among different demographic groups. The output includes aggregated and detailed insights on drug utilization, financial aspects of pharmacy claims (like copay and insurance payments), and patient engagement with pharmacy services. This comprehensive approach aids in enhancing healthcare delivery, optimizing pharmacy operations, and informing policy decisions related to drug coverage and patient care strategies.
